# Application-of-AI-for-Face-Recognition-using-Principal-Component-Analysis
This repository is a collection of work I have done during my undergraduate degree for unstructured image data to detect and recognize human face 6 different facial expressions using Principal Component Analysis

• Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on unstructured data in image format captured with 6 different human emotions using HDTV method for color normalization, PCA for feature extraction, and HAAR Cascade for face detection
• Built a machine learning model in Python for face recognition for testing data using PCA and Eigen Vectors after looking at various AI and deep 
learning techniques i.e., PCA, LDA, RCNN, Probabilistic PCA, Histogram of Gradients (HOG), features-based approach
